# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This dataset contains a lot of historical sales data of a Brazilian top retailer<br>
Basic Questions of every retailer : How much inventory should I carry?  Too much inventory means working capital costs, operational costs and a complex operation, lack of inventory leads to lost sales, unhappy customers and a damaged brand.<br>
This is why short-term forecasting is so important in the retail and consumer goods industry.
